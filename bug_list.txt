1. In step 2 if source marker is clicked, filter list is reset. - fixed
2. In step 4, , when new trip is selected, map is not reset without refresh. - fixed
3. Map is not centered properly on initial load - should take menu into account. - fixed
4. it is possible to set a destination as a source by playing with previous step button.
 - in second step apply filter then do previous step then next step again - fixed
 5. IN STEP 1 IF AL MUNEER IS TYPED, MUNEERA IS HIGHLIGHTED BUT NOT FILTERED TILL ONE MORE A IS TYPED
 6. iffilter reset is applied in step 3  - markers disappear
 7. It is easy to forget to apply filter in last step. Ensure there is an extra message to remind user to 
 apply filter one more time. Alternatively, if there is only one item on the list - could go for automated step transition right away.
 8. Seems like clicks work only on text area of the list items, should work on the entire "button".
